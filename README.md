iPhone Robot Controller is a software that aims at creating a robot server that is able to give to any properly configured robot commands for controlling a 4WD robot for the purpose of mapping an environment. The Arduino client sends sensor data to the iPhone server, that process the information, elaborate a strategy and answer back to Arduino with a command represented by wheel velocities.
